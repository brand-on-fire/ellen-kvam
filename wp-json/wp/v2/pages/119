My home town, Troms\u00f8, is famous for its long dark winters lit up by the magical Northern Lights. The summers are short and vibrant. When you live in\u00a0 the Arctic Circle, you experience things very intensely. Colors become very important to you.<\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u2019ve found that this colorful line of hand-crafted jewelry has touched a chord in women throughout Scandinavia and beyond. Women everywhere tell me they feel cheered by seeing their favorite colors placed in a fresh and modern style. They like being able to change their look in subtle ways. Having this little splash of color is refreshing.<\/p>\n<p>My jewelry business has since moved to sunny California. But every time I create a new line of colors, I\u2019m still reminded of Norway\u2019s bright blue waters, the deep orange of freshly caught lox, and the bright red wooden houses sitting tiny at the base of the green and silver fjords.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever corner of the world you\u2019re in, color brings joy and a sense of magic. In every collection, my designs are intentionally simple, elegant. I want to allow the woman to emerge from beneath the piece, not be overwhelmed by it. I know that when you wear something you love,\u00a0 it\u2019s more powerful than the most popular<br \/>\nfad. When it\u2019s truly yours, it\u2019s timeless.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"nav fusion-mobile-tab-nav\"><ul class=\"nav-tabs nav-justified\" role=\"tablist\"><li role=\"presentation\"><a class=\"tab-link\" data-toggle=\"tab\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"tab-aa3d4d394d9286af4b9\" aria-selected=\"false\" tabindex=\"-1\" id=\"mobile-fusion-tab-onlineform\" href=\"#tab-aa3d4d394d9286af4b9\"><h4 class=\"fusion-tab-heading\">Online Form<\/h4><\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"tab-pane fade fusion-clearfix\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-labelledby=\"fusion-tab-onlineform\" id=\"tab-aa3d4d394d9286af4b9\">\n<h1>Contact Ellen Kvam<\/h1>\n\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f7-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"7\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/119#wpcf7-f7-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"7\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0.6\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f7-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<p><label> Name*<br \/>\n<span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-name\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" \/><\/span> <\/label>\n<\/p>\n<p><label> Email*<br \/>\n<span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-email\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" value=\"\" type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" \/><\/span> <\/label>\n<\/p>\n<p><label> Phone*<br \/>\n<span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-tel\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-tel wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-tel\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"your-tel\" \/><\/span> <\/label>\n<\/p>\n<p><label> Message*<br \/>\n<span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-message\"><textarea cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" maxlength=\"2000\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" name=\"your-message\"><\/textarea><\/span> <\/label>\n<\/p>\n<p><input class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-submit has-spinner\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" \/>\n<\/p><p style=\"display: none !important;\" class=\"akismet-fields-container\" data-prefix=\"_wpcf7_ak_\"><label>&#916;<textarea name=\"_wpcf7_ak_hp_textarea\" cols=\"45\" rows=\"8\" maxlength=\"100\"><\/textarea><\/label><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"ak_js_1\" name=\"_wpcf7_ak_js\" value=\"236\"\/><script>document.getElementById( \"ak_js_1\" ).setAttribute( \"value\", ( new Date() ).getTime() );<\/script><\/p><div class=\"fusion-alert alert custom alert-custom fusion-alert-center wpcf7-response-output awb-alert-native-link-color alert-dismissable awb-alert-close-boxed\" style=\"--awb-border-top-left-radius:0px;--awb-border-top-right-radius:0px;--awb-border-bottom-left-radius:0px;--awb-border-bottom-right-radius:0px;\" role=\"alert\"><div class=\"fusion-alert-content-wrapper\"><span class=\"fusion-alert-content\"><\/span><\/div><button type=\"button\" class=\"close toggle-alert\" data-dismiss=\"alert\" aria-label=\"Close\">&times;<\/button><\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"nav fusion-mobile-tab-nav\"><ul class=\"nav-tabs nav-justified\" role=\"tablist\"><li role=\"presentation\"><a class=\"tab-link\" data-toggle=\"tab\" role=\"tab\" aria-controls=\"tab-ca85dd36cb7ad1819a6\" aria-selected=\"false\" tabindex=\"-1\" id=\"mobile-fusion-tab-terms&amp;conditions\" href=\"#tab-ca85dd36cb7ad1819a6\"><h4 class=\"fusion-tab-heading\">Terms &amp; Conditions<\/h4><\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class=\"tab-pane fade fusion-clearfix\" role=\"tabpanel\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-labelledby=\"fusion-tab-terms&amp;conditions\" id=\"tab-ca85dd36cb7ad1819a6\">\n<h1 class=\"turquiose\">Terms &amp; Conditions of Use<\/h1>\n<p>Thank you for visiting ellenkvam.com and its related pages (the \u201c<strong>Site<\/strong>\u201d), provided by Ellen Kvam Glasskunst &amp; Design AS (the \u201c<strong>Company<\/strong>\u201d).
